The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the Applications to ensure they remain relevant to you or compatible with the specific version of the operating system installed on your device. However, you agree to accept updates to the Applications whenever they are offered.

Additionally, the Service Provider may choose to cease providing the Applications and may terminate your access at any time without prior notice. Unless informed otherwise, upon termination: (a) the rights and licenses granted to you under these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the Application and, if necessary, delete it from your device.
